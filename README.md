I'm an engineer with a passion for UX. I like to design and build stuff. By day, I manage a team of engineers at [Globant](https://www.globant.com/), but I never shy away from some fun, hands-on projects on the side 🙃

👨‍💻 I’m lately enjoying tools like:

- NextJS, NuxtJS and SvelteKit
- Tailwind, HeadlessUI, RadixUI
- TypeScript
- NestJS, Directus & GraphQL
- Turborepo
- Deno & Bun
- AWS, GCP, Vercel and Edge Computing
- web3, walletconnect, hardhat and truffle
- GPT-3 and DALL-E APIs
